# 👋 Hi there, I'm Emely!

🎓 I'm currently studying **Cyber Security (B.Sc.)** at IU International University (3rd semester) and expanding my knowledge through platforms like Coursera – with a strong focus on **ethical hacking**, **penetration testing**, and **IT security**.

🛠️ I love working with different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and enjoy learning how systems work – and how to secure them. I'm especially comfortable with **Kali Linux** and **Arch Linux**.

🔍 My long-term goal: To become a professional **Penetration Tester** or **Cyber Security Analyst**, helping companies stay one step ahead of digital threats.

🚀 Currently learning:
- Network security & vulnerability scanning
- Python scripting for automation
- CEH certification basics
- Exploitation techniques in test labs

🧰 Tools & Technologies:
- `Kali Linux`, `nmap`, `Burp Suite`, `Wireshark`, `Metasploit`
- `Python`, `Bash`, `Java`
- `VirtualBox`, `Docker`, `Git`

📚 Selected Projects (more coming soon!):
- 🕵️‍♀️ TryHackMe / HackTheBox CTF writeups
- 🛡️ Security automation scripts (Python/Bash)

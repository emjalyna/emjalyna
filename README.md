# 👋 Hi there, I’m Emely

I’m a Cyber Security (B.Sc.) student with a growing focus on IT Security, Digital Forensics, and Game Design.
I enjoy understanding how systems work, finding vulnerabilities, and exploring creative ways to combine security and technology.

My current projects and studies revolve around topics like network and system security, incident analysis, and developing small tools and scripts in Python to support investigations or testing environments.
I’m also learning to design and prototype games, applying logic and problem-solving skills from my security background.


🧠 Current focus

Penetration testing and system hardening

Digital forensics & evidence handling

Python scripting for security use cases

Swift & Xcode for game development


🌱 Goals

I aim to deepen my technical understanding of security and forensics, expand my hands-on experience through personal projects, and eventually contribute to professional environments that value curiosity, creativity, and precision.


💻 Projects
Here are a few areas I’m currently exploring or working on:

🔍 Forensic Case Study – analyzing digital evidence and reporting findings

🧰 Python Security Tools – small utilities for scanning, parsing logs, or monitoring network activity

🕹️ Study & Focus App (iOS) – a minimal timer app inspired by StudyBunny, built with Swift

🧠 Learning Lab – experimenting with virtual machines, Arch Linux, and different security tools

# 👋 Hi, I’m Emely

I’m currently a Cyber Security (B.Sc.) student exploring different paths within and beyond IT.

I’m interested in understanding how systems work, how technology impacts people, and where my skills and curiosity fit best long-term.  
Right now, I’m focusing less on building projects and more on learning, reflecting, and gaining clarity about my future direction.

## 🌱 Current focus

- Studying Cyber Security fundamentals  
- Exploring topics like systems, security, and digital technologies  
- Reflecting on long-term career paths (inside or outside of IT)  
- Building a solid theoretical foundation before committing to a specialization

## 🎯 What matters to me

I value curiosity, clarity, and depth over rushing into a predefined role.  
Rather than forcing myself into a niche too early, I want to understand my strengths and interests properly before moving forward.
